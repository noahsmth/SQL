#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT count(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
SELECT count(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 ;

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales as feb
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.customers as cust
on feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT DISTINCT product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price<=
(SELECT MIN (price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)
AND length(orderid) = 6;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(quantity)
,product
,sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101' 
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum)
,avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb

LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
on cust.order_id = feb.orderid

WHERE feb.quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6;
